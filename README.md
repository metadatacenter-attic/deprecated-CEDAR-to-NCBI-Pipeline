## Welcome to the CEDAR-to-NCBI Data Submission Pipeline

**Introduction**  

The CEDAR-to-NCBI data submission pipeline helps investigators and curators to edit and validate ontology-controlled metadata, and it provides a seamless interface to transmit datasets to the NCBI from the CEDAR Workbench. The CEDAR-to-NCBI pipeline attempts to improve quality of metadata hosted by the NCBI and accelerate the broader goal of data FAIRness.

**Do you have a CEDAR login?**  

To use this pipeline, you will need an account on the CEDAR Workbench. If you do not have one, you can [create one](https://auth.metadatacenter.org/auth/realms/CEDAR/login-actions/registration?client_id=cedar-angular-app).

**We have made NCBI submission process simple for you.**

1- Click on this link [CEDAR-to-NCBI Pipeline](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/dashboard?folderId=https:%2F%2Frepo.metadatacenter.net%2Ffolders%2Fe9eeb4a3-449b-4f4b-9db6-fd353d56501f). This will take you to the CEDAR login-in panel.

2- If you are new user user, you have to create an account.

3- After login into the system, you will see CEDAR-NCBI template.

4- Right click on the template (CEDAR-NCBI)  file and click on the “populate” option from menu.

5- Try to enter metadata for the Tissue, Cell type and organism fields to see how these are controlled through ontologies.
